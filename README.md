# College_ERP_System
Our project aims to integrate all the modules and functionalities of a college 
system in a single application with our College Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) system.
Features include attendance, 
marks and time table. We have decided to have eight entities to incorporate all 
aspects of our project:
● DEPARTMENT 
● CLASS
● TEACHER
● COURSE
● STUDENT
● ASSIGN_TIME
● ATTENDANCE 
● MARKS
**ER Tool**
Lucidchart is the ER tool we have used to make our ER diagram. Lucidchart is a webbased proprietary platform that allows users to draw charts and diagrams. We chose 
to use Lucidchart as it allowed us to collaborate while making the final ER diagram.
