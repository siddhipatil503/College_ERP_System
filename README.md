# College_ERP_System
Our project aims to integrate all the modules and functionalities of a college 
system in a single application with our College Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) system.
Features include attendance, marks and time table. We have decided to have eight entities to incorporate all aspects of our project:
- DEPARTMENT 
- CLASS
- TEACHER
- COURSE
- STUDENT
- ASSIGN_TIME
- ATTENDANCE 
- MARKS
